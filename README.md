# My Notes

**Chrome Extension** that turns your **"New Tab"** into **a note taking tool.**

- Great for Notes, Todos, and sharing text (Copy/Paste)

- It works immediately after you open a **"New Tab"**

- Every edit and paste is saved (and waiting for you once you come back)

- And! It is Synchronized across every Chrome window you have open

There are 2 options available, one saves the note to your machine,
the second option saves the note to Chrome Sync,
so it can be picked up from any other machine of yours
(requirement: logged into Google Account).
