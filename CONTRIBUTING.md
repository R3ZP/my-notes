Here are some ways how you can support My Notes and help me to make it better.

## Feedback

> _I would like to have (or no have) feature ABC._
>
> _This is great. Thank you!_
>
> _Can we change this?_
>
> _This isn't very clear. What is it?_
>
> Hey, I think I found a mistake.
>
> Wow! This is really simple!

Good or bad feedback is ok. Don't think about it much.

Feedback is important to understand what you would like to see or have changed.

## Testing

Testing helps to eliminate mistakes and to bring better quality and compatibility.

If you would like, you can help me to test an upcoming version of My Notes before it gets released.

## English

> _Oh. Here's a typo!_
>
> _I am a native English. Bring it on!_
>
> _This paragraph is better to write like this._

If you spot something that can be written in a better way, please, let me know.

<br>

## Design

> _Look! This icon is perfect!_
>
> _How about this banner I made?_
>
> _How about using this color?_
>
> _I have made a new template/layout._

If you are a designer, there is always an opportunity to make things more nice and sleek!

## Development

> _I have found a bug/improvement. Here's my PR!_
>
> _I am new to this but still would like to help/learn. Can you find something for me?_

If you are new or experienced, I would try to find ways how to work together.
